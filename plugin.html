<!-- plugin.html: if the text in the textbox has the word “plugin” in it, then a hyperlink is created
using document.createElement and appended to the body. Its href attribute value will be
“plugin.html” which is another web page that you have written too. Here you will show off any  

jquery plugin you want. There are some awesome and useful jquery plugins, and you can choose
any one. Clearly, the more “wow” it has, the better it is.
