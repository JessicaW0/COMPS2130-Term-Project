<!-- single textbox and a button 
  - type in storage, a hyperlink is created using document.createElement and appended to the body 
  Its href attribute value will be “storage.html”

  -
index.html has comments about what each partner did
-----------------------------------------------------
If the text in the textbox has the word “alien” in it, then an alien image is
 created and appended to the body of index.html. The alien stays on the document 
 from this point on. If the user types “walk” in the textbox and presses the button
  after the alien has been created, the alien will pace back and forth at 1px every
   100ms. If the user types “run” in the textbox and presses the button after the
    alien has been created, the alien will pace back and forth at 1px every 10ms.
     If the user types “stop” in the textbox and presses the button after the alien
      has been created, the alien will stop moving. If the user types “bye” in 
      the textbox and presses the button after the alien has been created, the
       alien will be removed from the document (display:none).

Alien appears when alien typed into textbox and button clicked

Alien walks when walk typed into textbox and button clicked

Alien runs when run typed into textbox and button clicked

Alien stops when stop typed into textbox and button clicked

Alien disappears when bye typed into textbox and button clicked

----------------------------------------------------------------
If the text in the textbox has the word “jquery” in it, then use plain-old
 JavaScript to create four images on index.html. Then use jQuery to do the 
 following: all images must get an HTML width attribute of 200; when the 
 second image gets clicked, it gets a big fat red border.

Four images get created when jquery typed into textbox and button clicked
jquery is used to resize html width attribute of all images
jquery is used to change css border of second image when it is clicked
